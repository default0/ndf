NDF stands for Nested Dictionary Format.

It's a simple file format for storing arbitrary data, with some shortcuts.
If you're interested in the format itself, see example.ndf (open with a text editor), if not, using it should hopefully
be mostly straightforward just from the documentation in the code :)
